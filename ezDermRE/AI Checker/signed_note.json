Pea sized amount to entire face and follow with moisturizer every other night. .\n    Patient education:\n        - http://dermnetnz.org/acne/\n        - Acne is a common chronic disorder affecting the hair follicle and sebaceous gland, in which there is expansion and blockage of the follicle and inflammation. There are several variants. Acne affects males and females of all races and ethnicities. It is prevalent in adolescents and young adults, with 85% of 16-18 year olds affected. However, it may sometimes occur in children and adults of all ages. Acne is due to a combination of factors, such as familial tendency and acne bacteria. Flares of acne can be provoked by several factors such as medications and diet. Treatment for acne depends on its severity and includes topical and oral medications, light therapy, and laser treatment. Acne tends to improve after the age of 25 years but may persist, especially in females.\n\nAtopic dermatitis\n    Plan:\n        - tacrolimus 0.1 % ointment topical, 1 Application, BID, 30 Days, 30 Grams, 2 Refills. 1(one) application(s) topical 2(two) times a day as maintenance until clear .\n        - triamcinolone acetonide 0.1 % cream Topical, 1 Application, BID, 30 Days, 454 Grams. 1(one) application(s) topical 2(two) times a day x 2 weeks then d.c until future flare .\n    Patient education:\n        - Atopic Dermatitis is a chronic condition that can be controlled by either topical medications or light therapy.  It is recommended to follow treatment as prescribed and if condition worsens or does not improve within 4-6 weeks, to schedule a follow up appointment for reevaluation.  It is important to make sure to also apply over the counter creams to keep skin hydrated.  \n\nPostinflammatory skin pigmentation change\n    Patient education:\n        - https://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/postinflammatory-hyperpigmentation/\n        - Patches developed after skin inflammation. Will improve over time if kept out of the sun and further inflammation is prevented. Apply sunscreen to exposed areas daily.\n\nKeratosis pilaris\n    Patient education:\n        - http://www.dermnetnz.org/acne/keratosis-pilaris.html\n        - KP is a condition that forms when the body produces too much of a protein called keratin.  When this occurs, it can block hair follicles and cause bumps to form over the arms, thighs, cheeks, and buttocks.  This benign condition may clear up on its own by following the self-care measures listed below:\n\n-Use warm water and limit bath time. Hot water and long showers or baths remove oils from the skin. Limit bath or shower time to about 10 minutes or less. Use warm, not hot, water.\n\n-Be gentle to the skin. Avoid harsh, drying soaps. Gently remove dead skin (exfoliate) with a washcloth or loofah. Vigorous scrubbing or removal of hair follicle plugs may irritate the skin and aggravate the condition. After washing or bathing, gently pat or blot the skin with a towel so that some moisture remains.\n\n-Try medicated creams. Apply an over-the-counter cream that contains urea (Nutraplus, Eucerin), lactic acid (AmLactin, Lac-Hydrin), alpha hydroxy acid or salicylic acid. These creams help loosen and remove dead skin cells. They also moisturize and soften dry skin. Put on this product before moisturizer.\n\n-Moisturize. While the skin is still moist from bathing, apply a moisturizer that contains lanolin (Lansinoh, Medela), petroleum jelly (Vaseline) or glycerin (Glysolid). These ingredients soothe dry skin and help trap moisture. Thicker moisturizers work best, such as Eucerin and Cetaphil. Reapply the product to the affected skin several times a day.\n\n-Use a humidifier. Low humidity dries out the skin. A portable home humidifier or one attached to your furnace will add moisture to the air inside your home.\n\n-Avoid friction from tight clothes. Protect affected skin from the friction caused by wearing tight clothes.\n\n",
